# Routing Implementation

## Overview
The website has been converted from a single vertically scrolling page to a multi-page application using React Router. This implementation maintains the header and footer across all pages while providing dedicated routes for each section.

## Changes Made

1. **Installed React Router**
   ```
   npm install react-router-dom
   ```

2. **Created Component Structure**
   - Layout components:
     - `Header.tsx`: Navigation header with router links
     - `Footer.tsx`: Shared footer component
     - `Layout.tsx`: Wrapper component that includes Header, Footer, and Outlet for page content
   
   - Page components:
     - `HomePage.tsx`: Home page content
     - `TechPage.tsx`: Technology section
     - `DJPage.tsx`: DJ section
     - `MusicPage.tsx`: Music production section
     - `CarsPage.tsx`: Automotive section
     - `ContactPage.tsx`: Contact form

3. **Updated App.tsx with Routes**
   - Implemented React Router with routes for each section
   - Set up nested routes within the Layout component

4. **Modified Navigation**
   - Updated navigation links to use React Router's Link component
   - Ensured proper routing between pages

## How to Test

1. The development server is running at http://localhost:5174/
2. Navigate to the following routes to test each page:
   - Home: http://localhost:5174/
   - Technology: http://localhost:5174/tech
   - DJ: http://localhost:5174/dj
   - Music: http://localhost:5174/music
   - Cars: http://localhost:5174/cars
   - Contact: http://localhost:5174/contact

3. Verify that:
   - The header and footer remain consistent across all pages
   - Navigation links correctly route to the appropriate pages
   - Each page displays its specific content

## Future Enhancements

1. **Content Development**
   - Enhance each page with more specific content
   - Add media and portfolio elements

2. **Visual Design**
   - Develop distinct visual styles for each section
   - Implement responsive design improvements

3. **Functionality**
   - Add form validation and submission
   - Implement media galleries and interactive elements
