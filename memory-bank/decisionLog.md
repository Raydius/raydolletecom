# Decision Log

## March 2, 2025 - Memory Bank Implementation

**Context:** The project needed a system to track architectural decisions, maintain context across sessions, and document progress.

**Decision:** Implemented a Memory Bank system with core documentation files.

**Rationale:** 
- Provides consistent project documentation
- Maintains context between development sessions
- Tracks decisions and their rationale
- Organizes project priorities and progress

**Implementation:** Created memory-bank directory with core files:
- productContext.md
- activeContext.md
- progress.md
- decisionLog.md

## March 2, 2025 - Content Management Approach

**Context:** Based on the existing codebase, content is managed through a staticCopy.json file.

**Decision:** Continue using the JSON-based content management approach.

**Rationale:**
- Provides a clean separation between content and presentation
- Makes content updates straightforward without changing component code
- Allows for potential future integration with a CMS if needed
- Maintains the current project architecture

**Implementation:** Will enhance the existing staticCopy.json with more detailed and specific content for each section.

## March 2, 2025 - Multi-Page Routing Implementation

**Context:** The website was initially a single vertically scrolling page with anchor links for navigation.

**Decision:** Implemented React Router to create separate pages for each section while maintaining a consistent header and footer.

**Rationale:**
- Improves user experience by providing dedicated pages for each content section
- Enables cleaner URLs (e.g., /tech, /dj, /music) instead of anchor links
- Maintains the shared header/footer across all pages for consistent navigation
- Allows for more focused content on each page
- Provides better organization as content grows

**Implementation:**
- Installed React Router
- Created a Layout component with shared Header and Footer
- Extracted each section into its own page component
- Set up routes in App.tsx
- Updated navigation links to use React Router's Link component
- Maintained the same visual design and content structure

## Future Decisions to Consider

### Visual Design System
- Need to decide on a cohesive design system that can accommodate different content types
- Consider how to visually distinguish between different interest sections

### Media Management
- Determine how to handle media assets (images, audio, video) for DJ, music, and car content
- Consider performance implications and loading strategies

### Interaction Design
- Decide on navigation patterns and user flow between different sections
- Consider animations and transitions for enhanced user experience
