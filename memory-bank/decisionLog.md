# Decision Log

## March 2, 2025 - Memory Bank Implementation

**Context:** The project needed a system to track architectural decisions, maintain context across sessions, and document progress.

**Decision:** Implemented a Memory Bank system with core documentation files.

**Rationale:** 
- Provides consistent project documentation
- Maintains context between development sessions
- Tracks decisions and their rationale
- Organizes project priorities and progress

**Implementation:** Created memory-bank directory with core files:
- productContext.md
- activeContext.md
- progress.md
- decisionLog.md

## March 2, 2025 - Content Management Approach

**Context:** Based on the existing codebase, content is managed through a staticCopy.json file.

**Decision:** Continue using the JSON-based content management approach.

**Rationale:**
- Provides a clean separation between content and presentation
- Makes content updates straightforward without changing component code
- Allows for potential future integration with a CMS if needed
- Maintains the current project architecture

**Implementation:** Will enhance the existing staticCopy.json with more detailed and specific content for each section.

## March 2, 2025 - Multi-Page Routing Implementation

**Context:** The website was initially a single vertically scrolling page with anchor links for navigation.

**Decision:** Implemented React Router to create separate pages for each section while maintaining a consistent header and footer.

**Rationale:**
- Improves user experience by providing dedicated pages for each content section
- Enables cleaner URLs (e.g., /tech, /dj, /music) instead of anchor links
- Maintains the shared header/footer across all pages for consistent navigation
- Allows for more focused content on each page
- Provides better organization as content grows

**Implementation:**
- Installed React Router
- Created a Layout component with shared Header and Footer
- Extracted each section into its own page component
- Set up routes in App.tsx
- Updated navigation links to use React Router's Link component
- Maintained the same visual design and content structure

## March 2, 2025 - Header Styling with Refined Dark Brushed Metal

**Context:** The header needed a distinctive visual style that would stand out and create a professional, premium appearance.

**Decision:** Refined the dark brushed metal background effect for the header with pure horizontal brushed lines

**Rationale:**
- Creates a distinctive, premium look that stands out from the content
- Provides a consistent visual anchor across all pages
- Aligns with technical/professional nature of the portfolio
- Dark metal provides good contrast for navigation text
- Horizontal brushed texture accurately represents real brushed metal

**Implementation:**
- Used repeating horizontal linear gradients to create thin brushed lines:
  - Created a pattern of alternating light and dark horizontal lines
  - Used 0deg direction to ensure purely horizontal brushing
  - Adjusted opacity and color values for better visibility
- Added a second repeating gradient for subtle horizontal highlights
- Kept the SVG noise texture for realistic metal grain
- Enhanced box-shadow and border effects for better depth and dimension:
  - Added inset shadows at top and bottom
  - Used border-top with light color for edge highlight
  - Increased the main shadow for better separation from content
- Darkened the base color for better contrast with the metallic highlights

## March 2, 2025 - Navigation Link Focus Styling

**Context:** The default blue focus box around navigation links was inconsistent with the site's design aesthetic.

**Decision:** Replaced the blue focus box with a bold white underline for navigation links.

**Rationale:**
- Improves visual consistency with the site's design language
- Maintains accessibility by providing clear visual feedback for keyboard navigation
- Creates a more elegant and subtle focus indicator
- Aligns with the white text color used in the navigation
- Provides a cleaner, more intentional design

**Implementation:**
- Added specific CSS for `.nav a:focus` in Layout.css
- Removed the default outline using `outline: none`
- Added a 3px solid white border-bottom for the underline effect
- Increased font-weight to 600 for better visibility when focused
- Added position: relative and padding-bottom to accommodate the underline
- Included the border-bottom in the transition properties for smooth animation

## Future Decisions to Consider

### Visual Design System
- Need to decide on a cohesive design system that can accommodate different content types
- Consider how to visually distinguish between different interest sections

### Media Management
- Determine how to handle media assets (images, audio, video) for DJ, music, and car content
- Consider performance implications and loading strategies

### Interaction Design
- Decide on navigation patterns and user flow between different sections
- Consider animations and transitions for enhanced user experience
