# Decision Log

## March 2, 2025 - Memory Bank Implementation

**Context:** The project needed a system to track architectural decisions, maintain context across sessions, and document progress.

**Decision:** Implemented a Memory Bank system with core documentation files.

**Rationale:** 
- Provides consistent project documentation
- Maintains context between development sessions
- Tracks decisions and their rationale
- Organizes project priorities and progress

**Implementation:** Created memory-bank directory with core files:
- productContext.md
- activeContext.md
- progress.md
- decisionLog.md

## March 2, 2025 - Content Management Approach

**Context:** Based on the existing codebase, content is managed through a staticCopy.json file.

**Decision:** Continue using the JSON-based content management approach.

**Rationale:**
- Provides a clean separation between content and presentation
- Makes content updates straightforward without changing component code
- Allows for potential future integration with a CMS if needed
- Maintains the current project architecture

**Implementation:** Will enhance the existing staticCopy.json with more detailed and specific content for each section.

## Future Decisions to Consider

### Visual Design System
- Need to decide on a cohesive design system that can accommodate different content types
- Consider how to visually distinguish between different interest sections

### Media Management
- Determine how to handle media assets (images, audio, video) for DJ, music, and car content
- Consider performance implications and loading strategies

### Interaction Design
- Decide on navigation patterns and user flow between different sections
- Consider animations and transitions for enhanced user experience
