But when I got Krish on the phone and explained the brief to him, he wasn&#8217;t interested.",

And to put that much effort into something, we have to believe in it. And, truthfully, the Payday Loan business had a lot of negative implications with predatory lending and all that. And it just didn&#8217;t feel like the kind of thing we could feel good about.</span>",

We&#8217;re actually not very good at working with clients who want more of the same. It&#8217;s when they want to radically change their business, growth, trajectory and market share that we&#8217;re the right firm to call.</span>",

        "<span>And because we&#8217;re focused on the totality of a clients&#8217; business, we have to offer holistic thinking instead of silo-ed thinking. So our designers inform our strategy. Our strategy informs our design. Our UX informs our business strategy and so on.</span>"

Not just with co-workers with different points of view and skill sets, but also with our clients and partner agencies. We don&#8217;t care who&#8217;s "right", we just want the end product to be stunning.</span>',
        "<span>The last thing that really makes us different is our process. While traditional agencies follow a linear process, we believe in constant iteration. We have to be able to throw away good work to get to great work. And at every step of the journey, we are learning new things, so we have to be adaptable and nimble so we can incorporate those insights to make the final product something really special.</span>",

        "<span>PHNO: Our people are strategists who love strategy, but hate the limits of working at a strategy firm. They&#8217;re designers who love design, but feel handcuffed working at a design shop. They&#8217;re digital leaders who don&#8217;t want to be so disconnected from the brand thinking. And they&#8217;re ad agency leaders who are sick and tired of being relegated to just TV, Print and Out of Home. They&#8217;re all looking for innovation.
